# ETL-Project (Summary)
CSV 1 (Crime Data)
I chose a Data set regarding Hate crimes in India (https://www.kaggle.com/khalidative/crimeanalysis); there were four data sets to choose from based upon different ways the crime data was captured (by state, county, etc.) I chose to extract, transform, and load the data from the csv "crime_by_state." I was able to succesfully extract and transform the tables but was unsuccesfully with loading it onto PGAdmin properly.

CSV 2 (Shopping Data)
I chose a data set regarding shopping on Etsy (https://www.kaggle.com/sepidafs/etsy-shops). There was one data, which I chose to extract, transform, and load data from. I was able to successfully extract and transform the tables but unsuccessful with loading it. Though I'll be graded on this, I'll definitely ask a TA what's going on with my connection to my PG Admin server.
